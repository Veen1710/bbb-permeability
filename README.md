# bbb-permeability prediction
This repository contains my MSc research work exploring Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) permeability prediction using molecular descriptor-based machine learning models.
The objective was to evaluate whether chemical properties alone can classify compounds as BBB-permeable or non-permeable — a key challenge in CNS drug discovery.
